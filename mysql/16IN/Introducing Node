Now that we have a good understanding of mysql, lets get it to work with something else
In this course we are going to pair mysql with Node.
PHP is historically paired with mysql, but this course will use Node instead
so, with that said, how do we make them interact?
the client will ask NodeJS their question, then NodeJS will ask the MySQL Database
the MySQL database will respond to NodeJS who will deliver the response to client
what language serves as intermediary doesn't matter for this level of learning
"But What About PHP?" this course is using NodeJS, not PHP "8 min vid saying quit asking"

Our First Project! JOIN US 'a cult mailing list application'

USERS:
email VARCHAR
created_at DATETIME

the first goal is to use NodeJS to create many random users
